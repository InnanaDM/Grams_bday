<p>Hi, Grammie! Welcome to your virtual birthday card! I just want to say I love you to the moon and back. Being a grandmother provides you with an opportunity to help your grandchild gain a sense of who he or she really is. You guide me by showing me your wisdom, confidence, self discipline, soul-alignment, and your "I am who I am" mindset/attitude propels me forward everyday and I'm so thankful to you. Being an everyday grandmother has kept you young in body and heart. Im just saying, you are way hipper than my friends! I am so excited for the future, Grams. The decades ahead are going to be full of experiences/adventure! One day, we will travel the world together!! Okay, I could go on forever, but this salmon is waiting for us to cook it LOL! I love you, Grams. Happy Birthday! May 20, 2019  </p>
